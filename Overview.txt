automate adding custom sounds into jackbox games, specifically earwax.

Create a new .jet file and add as "custom content" in the manifest?
Basic Pseudo code:
- Read current file id from saved note

	- Read each files' name, save it in memory with id number
	- Move the file into the jackbox Earwaxaudio\audio
	- Rename it to id, save id in list
	- Repeat until no .ogg files are left in directory
- Open up EarwaxAudio.jet
	- Refer to memory
	- Enter template into audio .jet file, using saved name and id
	- repeat until last line of memory
